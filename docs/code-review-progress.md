1. Evaluate project structure and identify key domains to prioritize during review.
2. Review server-side logic (app/api, libs, prisma) for correctness and robustness.
3. Assess client-side components, hooks, and stores for clarity and potential bugs.
4. Consolidate findings with actionable recommendations.
